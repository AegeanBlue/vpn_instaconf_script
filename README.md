# outline_server_instaconf
 I got tired of reconfugiring my VPS that I  use for VPN, so here's the script that installs Outline Server + some hardening.

- Installs Curl, Iptables, Docker and Outline Server.
- Can change default SSH port, root login permission, hostname, timezone. Can create new user.
